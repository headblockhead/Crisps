Crisps!

A free-to-play game with NO ads and NO in-app purchases.

In this game, the only goal is to have the MOST Crisps at one point. Every time you press the CRISPS! button you get 1 (or more if you spend crisps on upgrades) crisps!
To aid you in your quest for crunching crisps, you can hire robots to make crisps for you so you don't have to do the hard work of pressing the button.
